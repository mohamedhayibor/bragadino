### 13- Write a function that takes a DNA sequence as a string then swap all elements to it's complement so that: 'A' -> 'T', 'T' -> 'A', 'C' -> 'G' and 'G' -> 'C'


### 14- How about we attack objects with our alchemy? Write a function that takes an object and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs


### 15- Write a function that takes an array of booleans and returns the number of trues (boolean value)


### 16- Write a function that adds your name or whatever value a 1000 times to an array


### 17- Let's go badass on arguments and arrays write a function that sums all numbers passed as arguments


### 18- Write a dropCap function that capitalizes the first letter of every word that has length greater than 2 leaving smaller words as they are.


### 19- Write a function that compares each pair of integers (same index) from 2 arrays and returns a new array of large numbers. Assumption: Both arrays have the same length


### 20- Do you use .every() often, let's take a stab at it. Write a function that checks if all arguments passed in are numbers


### 21- Alchemist 1.0.0: Entering the Alchmist dojo. Write a function that a non-negative integer and returns an array of the individual digits.


### 22- Write a function that takes an array, find the duplicates in that array and then returns a new array of unique values of the duplicates.


### 23- Your alchemist gigs got you a lot of money, so you decide to invest in a stock. Write a function to know how much your investment is worth with the given arguments:
> - invested(number), the amount of money you initially invested in the given share
> - changes(array of numbers), contains your shares daily movement percentages
> - round your final value using .toFixed(2)


### 24- Did you know that you could use the index of the array with map, reduce, reduceRight, every, filter, some ... Well, let's dive in an play with it. Write a function such as add(3,4,5); returns 26 => "( 3 * 1 ) + ( 4 * 2 ) + ( 5 * 3 )"


### 25- Create function with two arguments that will return a list of length (n) with multiples of (x). Assumptions: n && x > 0


### 26- Write a function that takes an integer as argument and outputs a string with currency format. ex: 123456 => "123,456"


### 27- How about including recursion into our alchemy? Write a function that takes an array of values. Sum every number value in the array, and any nested arrays (to any depth). Ignore all other types of values.


### 28- Let's have some wild laughs now with our skills. Write a function, mumbling such as:
> mumbling('abcd') => "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
> mumbling('darius') => "D-Aa-Rrr-Iiii-Uuuuu-Ssssss"


### 29- Write a function that takes a string and returns the same string with the rules:
> with all even indexed characters in each word upper cased
> all odd indexed characters in each word lower cased. 


### 30- Alchemy and a typical interview question: Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end preserving the order of the other elements.


### 31- I want to draw your attention on an insiduous temptation on nesting functions and getting lost in the process. Our goal as an alchemist is to use powerful tools that help us solve problems the easiest way possible, rather than causing confusion. Let's make the case with the following exercise:


>Implement a function (same as algorithm) that determines whether a string is an isogram. An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.


### 32- Have you ever wrote an encoder? let's create one. Write a duplicate encoder (function) that takes a word (string) then returns a string composing of "<" if the character is unique or ">" otherwise
> exple: duplicateEncoder('programmer') ===> "<><<><>><>"


### 33- given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
> Exple: a being 1, b being 2, etc. Ignore any character that is not a letter.
> Inject a space between the numbers for legibility


### 34- Write a global flatten method that takes any number of arguments and flattens them into a single array. Any nested arrays, no matter how deep should be flattened into the single array result.
> Exple: flatten(3 , ['John', 7], [NaN, 9], [[4], ['c']]) ===> [ 3, 'John', 7, NaN, 9, 4, 'c' ]
